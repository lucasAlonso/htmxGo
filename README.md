# Project Name: Learning Htmx and Go

## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly tutorial and sample application for learning the basics of using Htmx and the Go programming language. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on experience with Htmx and Go, helping you understand how to build web applications using this technology stack.

Htmx is a powerful tool for creating interactive, dynamic web pages without writing a lot of JavaScript. Go, on the other hand, is a versatile programming language that can be used for building web applications and APIs. This project combines both to create a simple web application to help you get started with these technologies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. If you don't have Go installed, you can download and install it from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).
